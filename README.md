### On the first day of induction, I went to the Gurudwara. After spending some time in bhakti, I got a message on WhatsApp from our community that we had to go to Ward No. 5 of the hostel. So we went there. They gave us toast, black rasgulla, and tea. I found the toast to be tastier. I gave Gulab Jamun to my friend. After that, we got a message that we have to meet in the auditorium. When we met in the auditorium, I met a girl. Later, we became friends. Her name is Ekam. When we went there, we were very well welcomed. All the seniors, HOD of Applied Science, and the principal also came. They also welcomed us well. They told us about our future in college. Our chief guest was an ex-cabinet minister. He also came to tell us how important it is not to bunk lectures. We should study not only to study, but also to understand and clear things. After that, we took a break. Before the break, I thought I would eat something in the canteen. Then my friend brought lunch. We shared that. When we were about to go back to the auditorium, it started raining on the way. We got wet. When we entered again, there were some seniors of the cosmic club. They told us that these seniors will come and show us their departments. After that, our teachers also came. They showed us the whole department. We enjoyed a lot. After that, we came back home. This was my day 1 of the induction program.

 ### Priya Darshni ma'am conducted a very insightful session on Universal Human Values. She discussed the true meaning of living a happy and fulfilling life. Her session focused on the concepts of happiness and contentment, and how these emotions influence our everyday choices and actions. The way she presented these ideas gave us a fresh perspective on what real happiness means. She also included relatable real-life examples, which made the session more engaging and easy to connect with.Later, we attended an interactive session led by Dr. Arvind Dhingra. He involved the audience by inviting seven boys and seven girls on stage to participate in a team strategy game.

# Day4
### Our classes were scheduled from 1pm to4pm today. All three of our lectures were scheduled in the auditorium. But when we reached there, the plan had changed a bit. We were messaged again that we don't want to go to the auditorium now. We have to go to some other class. So, according to my section, ECEA, I had to go to F112 class. And while going, I left home on time. But there was so much traffic on the way. By the way, I was already 10 minutes late. And the friends whom I had asked to wait for me, had already reached the class. So, I had to ask them on the phone, where is the class? Which side is it? And even they couldn't answer. Because the class had already started. So, it was very difficult for me to figure out which side is my class. And when I came, I was already late. Well, the class seniors were telling us which clubs are there in the college. At which places, we can become members. Requirements. And they were telling us about the marks. Like, in total, out of 100, how many marks will be for attendance? How many marks will be for extra curricular activities? And they also told us that, if we go to NCC sports, we can get 15 marks extra in total. And after that, when our lecture got over, they had told us that our next lecture will be in the auditorium. So, we all quickly reached the auditorium. After that, there was a lecture related to millet. At that time, we were told that, how important are millets for us. Jowar, Ragi, etc. These are very good for our nutrition. And most of the people don't like to eat these things or they don't find them tasty. Because they didn't want to cook properly. And the teacher had to tell us many more details about it. But we didn't have much time. So, our head teacher told the teacher to tell us about cooking first. Because we didn't have much time. So, she told us that, how can we cook it properly? How can we contain its nutrients and fibres? Which will be very helpful for us. And after that, we got a holiday. Then we came back home.
# Day5 
### Today's first lecture was given by Mr. Manpreet Singh who briefly explained to us about the concept of fitness for engineers. How engineers are so busy in their daily life that they don't have time to go to the gym etc. So how many exercises can they do at home for them? He said that if we don't have much time in the morning, we can exercise in the evening. And we can do basic cardio like exercise. He said that running is the best exercise in which our full body works. And running is very good for us. Other than that, he told us how we should eat healthy food, how nutritious and protein should be fulfilled in our daily life. He told us both non-veg and veg. Other than that, there were some kids who believed in gaining muscle etc. Or some kids went to the gym etc. So they also asked some questions related to that from Sir, whose doubts Sir answered very well and briefly. Other than that, our teacher told us that we should be told that if we do push-ups at home or do simple exercises, then how will it happen? Sir called some students and volunteers from our college so that they can come on stage and tell us how we should do push-ups exactly. And everyone performed very well. After that, Sir told us that our sports are very good. We should pay more attention to sports. He also told us about sports. And we came to know that there are very good athlete students in our college. For example, someone has completed 100 meters in 11 seconds. Someone has been playing Taekwondo for 15 years. Someone has been doing Gatka for a long time. And all such thingsBrigadier P.S. Cheema came to speak with us and shared his experience with the NCC, encouraging us to join the Army Defense Force since he is also part of it. He motivated us greatly. During his lecture, he noticed that the students were not in a good mood, so he decided to engage us in a game. He asked us to stand on our seats and move our right or left hand forward without moving our lower body. We had to rotate our hands as much as possible. Then, he asked us to close our eyes and imagine how far we could rotate our arms. When we opened our eyes and tried again, our arms moved a little more than before. He explained that this is the power of the mind — whatever you imagine can happen, if you believe in it.In addition to that, he spoke about the Defense Academy and emphasized the importance of focusing on studies and entertainment, rather than distractions, as college students. He encouraged us to participate in extracurricular activities like college clubs or NCC alongside our academics.After his lecture, we had a break. Once the break ended, we headed to our classroom, but before that, we had a physical education lecture. The instructor explained the distribution of marks for theory and practical exams and introduced us to some chapters that are likely to be included in the first semester.Then, Gautam Sir conducted a session on motorsports. He explained how important motorsports are and why engineers should give their best in this field. He discussed how Formula 1 racing cars are built, the need for speed, and the importance of teamwork. Different departments like CSE, EC, mechanical, and electrical engineering must work together to design and build a car. He also shared valuable information about car models, fuel efficiency 
# Day6
### Our first lecture today was about the physics lab, and it was taken by Professor Komalpreet Kaur. She introduced us to the basics of what we’ll be learning in the lab, the chapters and fundamental concepts,She also mentioned the important things we should know beforehand and shared some experiments that sounded really interesting, so we were quite excited about starting those soon. After that, we had a math lecture by Professor Sandeep Kaur Gill, who usually teaches the senior students. She explained the basics really well, but today, the classroom we were in didn’t have a blackboard, so she had to explain everything verbally. She mentioned that if there had been a blackboard, she would have asked us to write and that would have helped her gauge our understanding better, but we were actually relieved there wasn’t one! After that, we took a break and had some cold coffee after lunch Before heading to the auditorium, I had about 15 minutes, so my friends and I decided to explore the library. It was my first time there, and I found it quite exciting with lots of interesting books. Unfortunately, the time got a bit tight, and we had to head to the auditorium for the class.The  first lecture was by Dr. Lakhvir Singh Khanna on CML. He explained its importance and also introduced us to an app called SWAYAM for extra courses, which costs about a thousand rupees.After that, the second lecture was by Dr. Jasbir Singh Garewal on NSS, focusing on keeping the surroundings clean and adopting sustainable practices. There was a lovely musical performance by his club members, and then we all played some fun games, including a "try not to laugh" challenge with basketball. It was a lot of fun, and we ended up staying a bit longer than planned, but it was definitely worth it.Later, I got a notification that PMS students had to wait a bit more. We also had a quick briefing on scholarships, after which I met my cousin and headed home
