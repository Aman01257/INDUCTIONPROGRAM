# INDUCTIONPROGRAM
# Day1 
## Amanpreet kaur ECE BTech
### On the first day of induction, I went to the Gurudwara. After spending some time in bhakti, I got a message on WhatsApp from our community that we had to go to Ward No. 5 of the hostel. So we went there. They gave us toast, black rasgulla, and tea. I found the toast to be tastier. I gave Gulab Jamun to my friend. After that, we got a message that we have to meet in the auditorium. When we met in the auditorium, I met a girl. Later, we became friends. Her name is Ekam. When we went there, we were very well welcomed. All the seniors, HOD of Applied Science, and the principal also came. They also welcomed us well. They told us about our future in college. Our chief guest was an ex-cabinet minister. He also came to tell us how important it is not to bunk lectures. We should study not only to study, but also to understand and clear things. After that, we took a break. Before the break, I thought I would eat something in the canteen. Then my friend brought lunch. We shared that. When we were about to go back to the auditorium, it started raining on the way. We got wet. When we entered again, there were some seniors of the cosmic club. They told us that these seniors will come and show us their departments. After that, our teachers also came. They showed us the whole department. We enjoyed a lot. After that, we came back home. This was my day 1 of the induction program.
